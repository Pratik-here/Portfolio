Simple Porfolio Page using Bootstrap-4

Hi there, This is my first documentation. 

Purpose: To create a responsive portfolio web page using bootstrap-4.

Resources used : unsplash.com, pexels.com, cssgradients.io, fontawesome, flaticon.com

A big thanks to these free resources for making my coding life easier.

The page is divided into 3 sections. 

 1. Navbar Menu
	1.1 Navbar Brand
		1.1.1 Navbar Brand Logo
		1.1.2 Navbar Brand Heading
	1.2 Navbar Items
	(these link to the various places in my website)
 2. content-box
	(alternating box of content and images)
	(in mobile devices the text always appears first)
	2.1 About me section
	2.2 Random Image
	2.3 Download CV button
 3. footer
	3.1 links to various social media profiles.


Method:
Created a portfolio page with an index.hmtl. Thsi page contains all resources.
There is the html page with index.html. There are 3 folders, assets which includes all icons,fonts and images used.
There is a styles sheet with 4 files. Global styles link all global styles for the page. The variables.css includes variables for future reference and used.
There is a fonts.css for the fonts. 
This style of coding is inspired by dailytuitions(youtube).
